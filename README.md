 From Chip to Crop Hackathon — Turning Ideas into Impact! 🌱🤖

I recently had the opportunity to participate in the Chip to Crop Hackathon, and it turned out to be an incredibly exciting and learning-filled experience!

Our team worked on a Smart Pest Spraying Drone designed to make agriculture safer, smarter, and more efficient.
We integrated Deep Learning–based Leaf Disease Detection so the drone can identify infected plants and spray pesticides only where needed instead of across the entire field.
• AI-powered crop disease detection using computer vision
• Targeted pesticide spraying (reduces chemical usage)
• Saves farmer cost & time
• Eco-friendly precision agriculture approach
• Scalable for real-world farming conditions

:What I learned
This hackathon wasn’t just about building a prototype — it taught me:
• How hardware + AI can solve real-world problems
• Team collaboration under time pressure
• Turning research ideas into practical solutions
• The importance of sustainable technology in agriculture

Grateful for my teammates, mentors, and organizers who made this journey memorable.
This experience strengthened my interest in AI for Social Good & AgriTech innovation 🌍

Looking forward to building more technology that creates real impact!
